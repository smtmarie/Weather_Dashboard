# Weather Dashboard

In this project I developed a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Using the OpenWeather third-party API, I was able to access data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to the URL. I also used Local Storage to store any persistent data.


## User Story

AS traveler I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

Given a weather dashboard with form inputs, when I search for a city then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

When I view current weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.

When I view the UV index, then I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

When I view future weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.

When I click on a city in the search history, then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

When I open the weather dashboard, then I am presented with the last searched city forecast.
